# 🤖 AI Models Used

मनःSphere’s AI engine was built by training and comparing **12 models** across 3 categories:

---

## 1️⃣ Traditional Machine Learning Models
Using **TF-IDF (30k features)**:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Naïve Bayes**

Strengths: Fast & interpretable  
Weaknesses: No deep contextual understanding  

---

## 2️⃣ Deep Learning Models (Sequential)
Built using **TensorFlow/Keras** + **Word2Vec/GloVe** embeddings:

- **Text-CNN**  
- **BiLSTM**  
- **BiLSTM + Attention**  

Strengths: Captures word sequences & emotional cues  
Weaknesses: Weaker on long-context than Transformers  

---

## 3️⃣ Transformer Models (State-of-the-Art)
Using **HuggingFace Transformers**:

- **BERT Base**
- **DistilBERT Base**
- **MPNet Base**
- **DeBERTa-v3 Baseline (D1)**
- **DeBERTa-v3 Weighted-Focal (D2)**
- **DeBERTa-v3 Smoothed-Focal (D3)**

Strengths: Best emotional nuance + context understanding  
Weaknesses: Higher computational requirements
